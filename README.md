# Piano Scale Trainer
Piano Scale Trainer is a web application that can help you to internalize scale/modes pattern of the piano. It basicaly tests you to see if you can find the root, the mode, and the relative mode 0 of a given set of key.

It was made mainly in Javascript and I used the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library for the keyboard display.

The application can be found online [here](https://pianoscaletrainer-secondary.z6.web.core.windows.net/index.html)

## Usage

The application has in two states : setup state and test state

In the setup state you can specify the parameters of the test (scale, ask for root, ask for relative mode 0).

And in the test state, you need to select the right answers (root, mode, relative mode 0) of the displayed scale.
